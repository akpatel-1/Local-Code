# Types of Databases
 **Relational Databases:** 
  Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.  
  It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation.  
  Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, etc.
  
 **NoSQL Databases:** 
  It does not use SQL and does not store data in tabular format.  
  Designed for unstructured data and can handle large volumes of data.  
  Types include document databases (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), wide-column stores (e.g., Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).
